# Legacy React App with Redux

## Using legacy React v.15.5.4 (class components), redux@3.6.0, react-redux@5.0.5, redux-thunk@2.2.0, and Json-server@0.10.1. 
## Router is a custom made class component that provide current route through context (I am not using React Router). I followed Andy Van Slaars course on Egghead.io with minor changes.
